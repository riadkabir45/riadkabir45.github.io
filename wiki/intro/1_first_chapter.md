# First Steps with Markdown

Welcome to your first hands-on Markdown tutorial! In this chapter, you'll learn the fundamental building blocks of Markdown syntax.

## Headings

Headings are created using hash symbols (`#`). The number of hashes determines the heading level:

```markdown
# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section Title  
### H3 - Subsection Title
#### H4 - Sub-subsection
##### H5 - Minor heading
###### H6 - Smallest heading
```

### Result:

# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section Title  
### H3 - Subsection Title
#### H4 - Sub-subsection
##### H5 - Minor heading
###### H6 - Smallest heading

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are just regular text separated by blank lines:

```markdown
This is the first paragraph. It contains some text that demonstrates how paragraphs work in Markdown.

This is the second paragraph. Notice the blank line above separates it from the first paragraph.

This is a third paragraph with more content to show the pattern.
```

### Result:

This is the first paragraph. It contains some text that demonstrates how paragraphs work in Markdown.

This is the second paragraph. Notice the blank line above separates it from the first paragraph.

This is a third paragraph with more content to show the pattern.

## Line Breaks

For a line break without starting a new paragraph, end a line with two spaces:

```markdown
First line with two spaces at the end  
Second line on the next line
Third line after a regular line break

Fourth line after a paragraph break
```

### Result:

First line with two spaces at the end  
Second line on the next line
Third line after a regular line break

Fourth line after a paragraph break

## Horizontal Rules

Create horizontal rules (dividers) with three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---

***

___
```

### Result:

---

***

___

## Comments

You can add comments that won't appear in the rendered output:

```markdown
<!-- This is a comment and won't be visible -->
This text will be visible.
<!-- Another comment here -->
```

### Result:

<!-- This is a comment and won't be visible -->
This text will be visible.
<!-- Another comment here -->

## Practice Exercise

Try creating a simple document with:

1. A main heading (H1)
2. Two section headings (H2)
3. Three paragraphs under each section
4. A horizontal rule between sections
5. Some comments for your notes

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basic structure elements, you're ready to learn about [text formatting](intro/2_text_formatting) - making text **bold**, *italic*, and more!
